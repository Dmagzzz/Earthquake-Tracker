# About The Project
* When a user navigates to our website, they will be presented with a description of the
siteâ€™s functionality - an application where users can connect with their friends and ensure each
othersâ€™ safety in the event of an earthquake in their region. It will use a signup and login
functionality, and users can search other users by username to add to their friends list. When an
earthquake occurs in your region, the user will be prompted to set their status so others can
know how they are doing.
The siteâ€™s functionality incorporates a real-time earthquake API that will update in timed
intervals (we are currently looking into CronJob schedules to perform this function). For our
MVP, the application will start with two locations with seed data to test the functionality of the
applicationâ€™s system to prompt a user to update their status. If a user does not update their
status, it will default to unknown.
